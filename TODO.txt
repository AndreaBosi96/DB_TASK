To run the solution locally:
- import the db in your sql server
- update the db connection string in appsettings.json according to your system
- install necessary packages:
        -- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
        -- System.Data.SqlClient
- get into the project folder and run simple dotnet cmds
        -- dotnet restore
        -- dotnet run

Please note that the input file (after "Headers read") might take a couple of minutes to run. It is expecially due to a check about GUIDS.
With more time, I would have probably made the process faster using a different solution (maybe a hash set or using LINQ to first keep all rows and then elaborate).
